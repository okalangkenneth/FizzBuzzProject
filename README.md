# FizzBuzz Project

## Overview
The FizzBuzz project is an advanced implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem in C#. It demonstrates not only basic programming concepts but also incorporates modern development practices and features. This project iterates through numbers from 1 to 100 and applies the classic FizzBuzz rules:
- Print "Fizz" for numbers that are multiples of 3.
- Print "Buzz" for numbers that are multiples of 5.
- Print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5.
- Print the number itself for all other numbers.

The project includes asynchronous programming, user interaction, logging, error handling, input validation, and unit testing, making it a comprehensive example for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Features
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Demonstrates the use of async/await for potential I/O-bound operations.
- **User Interaction**: Interactive console-based UI for user input and interaction.
- **Logging**: Integrated with Serilog for detailed event and error logging.
- **Error Handling and Input Validation**: Robust error handling and validation for user inputs.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes unit tests using xUnit to ensure the correctness of the FizzBuzz logic.
- **XML Documentation**: Well-documented codebase for easy understanding and maintenance.

## Requirements
- .NET 5.0 or later (recommended for better support of recent features)
- Serilog packages for logging
- xUnit for unit testing
