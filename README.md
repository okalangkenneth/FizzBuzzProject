# FizzBuzzPlus Project

## Overview
The FizzBuzzPlus project extends the classic FizzBuzz logic with additional features, showcasing advanced programming concepts in C#. It iterates through numbers from 1 to 100 and applies modified FizzBuzz rules:
- Print "Fizz" for numbers that are multiples of 3 or contain 3.
- Print "Buzz" for numbers that are multiples of 5 or contain 5.
- Print a combination of "FizzBuzz" for numbers meeting both criteria above.
- Print the number itself if none of the criteria are met.
This project incorporates user interaction, logging, error handling, input validation, and unit testing, providing a comprehensive demonstration of various software development practices.

## Features
- **User Interaction**: Console-based UI for user input and interaction.
- **Logging**: Integrated with Serilog for detailed logging of application events and errors.
- **Error Handling and Validation**: Robust error handling and input validation for a smooth user experience.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes unit tests using xUnit to ensure the correctness of the logic.
- **XML Documentation**: Well-documented codebase for maintainability.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Demonstrates the use of async/await for efficient operations.

## Requirements
- .NET 5.0 or later (recommended for better support of recent features)
- Serilog packages for logging
- xUnit for unit testing
